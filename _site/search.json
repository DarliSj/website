It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or ‚Äòpredictors‚Äô). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‚Äòcriterion variable‚Äô) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.‚Äù\n.pull-right[ -Wikipedia]"

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for lectures by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded for completion.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on six components: application exercises, homework, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nApplication Exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team‚Äôs Git repository on the course‚Äôs GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member‚Äôs relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you‚Äôve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you‚Äôre learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you‚Äôve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through anaylsis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homeworks, and labs. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the final project is to apply what you‚Äôve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you‚Äôre not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It‚Äôs not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon‚Äôt procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don‚Äôt let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don‚Äôt cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard(DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\nRegardless ofcourse delivery format, itis the responsibility of all students to understand and followallDuke policies, includingacademic integrity(e.g., completingone‚Äôs own work, following proper citation of sources,adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more).Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what‚Äôs the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g.¬†StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Professor Tackett before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Professor Tackett know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of not attending. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. If you miss a lecture, make sure to review the lecture notes and complete the application exercise (if applicable that day) before the next class session.\nLab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you‚Äôre going to miss a lab session and you‚Äôre feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others‚Äô time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance Policy Related to COVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university‚Äôs top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to classif you have tested positive for COVID-19or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested.If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at coronavirus.duke.edu.\nTo keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participationin class."
