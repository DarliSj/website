    "text": "R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\n\nThis lab will go through much of the same workflow we’ve demonstrated in class. The main goal is to reinforce our demo of R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.\n\ngit is a version control system (like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).\n\nAn additional goal is to reinforce git and GitHub, the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course.\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\nTo make versioning simpler, this and the next lab are solo labs. In the future, you’ll learn about collaborating on GitHub and producing a single lab report for your lab team, but for now, concentrate on getting the basics down.\n\n\nBy the end of the lab, you will…\n\nBe familiar with the workflow using RStudio and GitHub\nGain practice writing a reproducible report using RMarkdown\nPractice version control using GitHub\nBe able to create data visualizations using ggplot2\nBe able to describe variable distributions and the relationship between multiple variables"

    "text": "Instructions\nWrite all code and narrative in your R Markdown file. Write all narrative in complete sentences. Throughout the assignment, you should periodically knit your R Markdown document to produce the updated PDF, commit the changes in the Git pane, and push the updated files to GitHub.\nTip: Make sure we can read all or your code in your PDF document. This means you will need to break up long lines of code. One way to help avoid long lines of code is is start a new line after every pipe (%>%) and plus sign (+).\n\nThe View function helped us get a quick view of the dataset, but let’s get more detail about its structure. Viewing a summary of the data is a useful starting point for data analysis, especially if the dataset has a large number of observations (rows) or variables (columns). Run the code below to use the glimpse function to see a summary of the ikea dataset.\n\nHow many observations are in the ikea dataset? How many variables?\n\nglimpse(ikea)\n\n\nWe begin each regression analysis with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help us “get to know” the data and examine the variable distributions and relationships between variables. We do this by visualizing the data and calculating summary statistics to describe the variables in our dataset. In this lab, we will focus on data visualizations.\n\nLet’s begin by looking at the price of Ikea furniture. Use the code below to visualize the distribution of price_usd, the price in US dollars.\n\nggplot(data = ikea, aes(x = price_usd)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the visualization to describe the distribution of price. In your narrative, include description of the shape, approximate center, approximate spread, and any presence of outliers.\nBriefly explain why the median is more representative of the center of this distribution than the mean.\n\n\nWhen we make visualizations, we want them to be clear and suitable for a professional audience. This means that, at a minimum, each visualization should have an informative title and informative axis labels. Let’s modify the plot from the previous question to make it suitable for a professional audience. Complete the code below to include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\n\nggplot(data = ikea, aes(x = price_usd)) +\n  geom_histogram() + \n  labs(x = \"_____\",\n       y = \"_____\", \n       title = \"_____\")\n\n\nCheck your lab-01 repo on the GitHub website (you may need to refresh the page in your browser) to ensure that all of the files are up-to-date.\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ This is a good place to knit, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-01 repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 1 - 3”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\nSee the [ggplot2 reference on density plots](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density.html) for code examples.\n\n\nAnother way to visualize numeric data is using density plots. Make a density plot to visualize the distribution of price_usd. Be sure to include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\nIn this course, we’ll be most interested in the relationship between two or more variables, so let’s begin by looking at the distribution of price by category. We’ll focus on the five categories in the code below, since these include commonly purchased types of furniture.\nUse the code below to create a new data frame that only includes the furniture categories of interest. We’re assigning this data frame to an object with a new name, so we don’t overwrite the original data.\nYou will use this new data frame for the remainder of the lab.\n\nikea_sub <- ikea %>%\n  filter(category %in% c(\"Tables & desks\", \"Beds\", \n                         \"Bookcases & shelving units\", \n                         \"Sofas & armchairs\", \"Children's furniture\"))\n\n\nLet’s make a new visualization with the density curves colored by category, so we can compare the distribution of price for each category.\n\n\nggplot(data = ikea_sub, aes(x = price_usd, fill = category)) +\n  geom_density() \n\n\n\n\nThe overlapping colors make it difficult to tell what’s happening with the distributions for the categories plotted first and hence covered by categories plotted over them. We can change the transparency level of the fill color to help with this. The alpha argument takes values between 0 and 1: 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. There is no way to tell what value will work best, so it’s best to try a few.\n\nggplot(data = ikea_sub, aes(x = price_usd, fill = category)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.8) \n\n\n\n\nRecreate the density plot using a more suitable alpha level, so we can more easily see the distribution of all the categories. Include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ This is a another good place to knit, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-01 repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 4 - 5”), and push every file to GitHub. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\nBriefly describe why we defined the fill of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot (inside the aes function) but we defined the alpha level as a characteristic of the plotting geom.\nOverlapping density plots are not the only way to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable. Use a different type of plot to visualize the relationship between price_usd and category. Include an informative title and informative axis labels.\n\nYou can use the ggplot2 cheatsheet and from Data to Viz for inspiration.\n\nCompare and contrast your plots from the previous exercise to the overlapping density plots from Exercise 5. What features are apparent in the plot from the previous exercise that aren’t in the overlapping density plots? What features are apparent in the overlapping density plots that aren’t in the plot from the previous exercise? What features are apparent in both?\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-01 repo on GitHub. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Completed exercises 6 - 8”), and push every file to GitHub by clicking the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.”\n\n\nNext, let’s look at the relationship between the price and width of Ikea furniture. Fill in the code below to visualize the relationship between the two variables using a scatterplot.\n\nUse your visualization to describe the relationship between the width and price of Ikea furniture.\n```{r eval = F} ggplot(data = _____, aes(x = width, y = _____)) + geom_point() + labs(x = “_____”, y = “_____”, title = “_____”) ````\n\nColor the points of the scatterplot by category. Describe how the relationship between price and width of Ikea furniture differs by category, if at all.\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ You’re done and ready to submit your work! Knit, commit, and push all remaining changes. You can use the commit message “Done with Lab 1!”, and make sure you have pushed all the files to GitHub (your Git pane in RStudio should be empty) and that all documents are updated in your repo on GitHub. The PDF document you submit to Gradescope should be identical to the one in your GitHub repo.\n\nSee the instructions below to submit your work on Gradescope."

It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or ‘predictors’). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‘criterion variable’) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.”\n\nSource: Wikipedia (previous definition)"

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website, sta210-fa22.netlify.app.\nAnnouncements will be emailed through Sakai Announcements periodically.

My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to prepare for lectures by completing assigned readings, attend all lecture and lab sessions, and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded for completion.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop, tablet, or Chromebook to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your device is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone."

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nYou will be assessed based on six components: application exercises, homework, labs, exams, project, and teamwork.\n\nApplication Exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Thursday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Saturday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on both conceptual understanding of the content and application through analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in reading assignments, lectures, application exercises, homeworks, and labs. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the final project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. The content builds upon what was taught in previous weeks, so if something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, etc. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours and work with a member of the teaching team to help you identify a good (re)starting point."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard(DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity(e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources,adhering to guidance around group work projects,and more).Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nFor the projects and team labs, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project or team labs across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work is accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Professor Tackett before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Professor Tackett know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade Requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nClass recordings request\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at https://forms.office.com/r/qU8ANXb6tB.\nPlease also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\nAbout one week before each exam, the class recordings will be available to all students. These videos will be available until the exam deadline.\n\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested.If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at coronavirus.duke.edu.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays"
