-   **GitHub** is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).
-   We will use GitHub as the home for course assignments and activities and for collaboration

## Git and GitHub tips

::: incremental
-   There are a lot of Git commands and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to commit, push, and pull.
-   We will be doing git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio
    -   If you Google for help, skip any methods for using git through the command line.
-   There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/).
    -   Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.
